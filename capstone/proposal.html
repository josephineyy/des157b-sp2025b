  <h1>Capstone Proposal: Glow Over Time</h1>

  <p><strong>Topic & Target Audience:</strong><br>
  My project, <em>Glow Over Time</em>, explores the evolution and consequences of urban light pollution through an interactive 3D visualization. Users will be able to toggle city lighting elements such as billboards, shopping malls, and streetlights across different years(different style maps), watching how their choices affect a city’s “light pollution score.” I will visualize the consequences of light pollution through declining star visibility, reduced sleep quality scores, increased anxiety levels and hidden costs of a glowing city. The target audience is everyone.</p>

  <p><strong>Lenses:</strong><br>
  This project strongly rely on <em>Data Visualization</em> to represent light pollution growth and its impact, while I have to use <em>Speculative Design</em> to imagine future urban scenarios based on user choices and possible over-illumination reasons. It also challenges the mental model that lighting is not pollution</p>

  <p><strong>Features & Challenges:</strong><br>
  I will build 3 3d Simulate city maps, corresponding to past, now and future, elements(buildings) would be clickable to illuminate. The illumination source will change overtime.Users are able to see consequences by see number of stars, how likely their sleep quality will be influenced, and hidden costs.</p>
