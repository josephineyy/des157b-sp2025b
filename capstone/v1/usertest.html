  <h1>Usability Test Results: Light is Pollution</h1>

  <h2>Key Observations</h2>

  <div class="observation">
    <p><span class="highlight">1. The scroll interaction was intuitive,</span> and the tester immediately tried scrolling without any prompt. The visual transitions between stages made the progress feel satisfying.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="observation">
    <p><span class="highlight">2. The changing text was noticed,</span> but the tester mentioned it could be emphasized more (e.g., fade-in or typewriter animation) to draw focus to the changing narrative.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="observation">
    <p><span class="highlight">3. The tester expected clickable elements,</span> especially on the glowing buildings. They hovered over them expecting tooltips or interactivity.</p>
  </div>


  <h2>Evaluation</h2>

  <p><strong>Areas that need improvement:</strong>  
  The emphasis on changing text can be stronger, and a small visual cue could help guide users to scroll. The background images could also fade more smoothly between transitions.</p>

  <p><strong>Was navigation clear?</strong>  
  Yes. The scroll-based interaction was naturally understood and used by the tester without confusion.</p>

  <p><strong>Was the message effective?</strong>  
  Mostly. The tester grasped the narrative arc but suggested the emotion behind the loss of stars could be pushed further with sound or more immersive visuals.</p>

  <p><strong>Modifications to be made:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Fade or animate title/subtitle text to emphasize changes</li>
    <li>Add a scroll cue or animated arrow at the beginning</li>
    <li>Consider hover effects or subtle interactivity on the city buildings</li>
    <li>Smooth transitions between background images</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Plan for Updates</h2>
  <p>Based on testing feedback, I will implement the following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Use a fade-in or typewriter effect to introduce each new stage’s text</li>
    <li>Add an animated arrow or glow effect at the bottom to prompt scrolling</li>
    <li>Optional: Add subtle sound transitions or ambient background audio</li>
    <li>Refine image transitions with opacity or crossfade effects</li>
  </ul>
