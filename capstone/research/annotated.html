    <h2>Rajkhowa, Rasna.</h2>
    <p><em>
      “Light Pollution and Impact of Light Pollution.” International Journal of Science and Research (IJSR), vol. 3, no. 10, Oct. 2014, pp. 861–867. 
      <a class="link" href="http://www.ijsr.net" target="_blank">www.ijsr.net</a>.
    </em></p>
    <p>This article provides a comprehensive overview of ecological light pollution, including its causes, types, and consequences. Dr. Rajkhowa discusses types of lighting pollution, such as sky glow, light trespass, over-illumination, glare, and clutter, and she also highlights how light pollution affects wildlife, plants, and human mental health. This source is extremely valuable for my project to help users learn what light pollution is, what type of light pollution is, and how it costs energy and affects plants, animals, humans, and astronomy adversely. The author concludes that we need to reduce light pollution and induct more research on this problem to raise the awareness of light pollution, which is the same as the purpose of my project.</p>

    <p><em>
      “Monitoring, Trends and Impacts of Light Pollution.” Nature Reviews Earth & Environment, vol. 5, June 2024, pp. 417–430. 
      <a class="link" href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s43017-024-00555-9" target="_blank">https://doi.org/10.1038/s43017-024-00555-9</a>.
    </em></p>
    <p>This review article offers quantitative data of light pollution’s global history and trends, monitoring techniques, and ecological, atmospheric, and societal impacts. It indicated the reasons why light pollution is increasing and detaily explained how light pollution is measured. The paper offers valuable reference for data visualization in my project. I can easily present the data and compare different light pollution levels across various cities. It also illustrates how light spreads and is scattered among different illumination sources, which is helpful for users to understand how common light affects light pollution. Overall, this source is critical for informing both the scientific context and visual storytelling aspects of my project.</p>

    <p><em>
      “How Light Pollution Harms the Planet and What to Do About It.” World Economic Forum, 6 Mar. 2025.

    </em></p>
    <p>This article explores the environmental, health, and climate consequences of light pollution. It emphasizes how artificial lighting disrupts wildlife and human circadian rhythms while also wasting vast amounts of energy. Notably, the article quantifies this waste by stating that saving excess outdoor lighting results in nearly saving $15.7 million in annual costs and generates carbon emissions equivalent to 38 million car miles — about 80 roundtrips from Earth to the Moon. These tangible comparisons help communicate the scale of the problem to general audiences. The article concludes with actionable solutions—such as motion sensors, downward-facing fixtures, and public education—to curb unnecessary light use and mitigate its wide-ranging effects.</p>
